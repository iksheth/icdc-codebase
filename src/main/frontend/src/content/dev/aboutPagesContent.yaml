  title: "Steering Committee"
  content:
    - paragraph: 'The ICDC (Integrated Canine Data Commons) is community $$*driven*$$  and built with input and collaboration from many 
        groups to foster a diversity of ideas and to ensure needs are identified across the broad 
        $${Research Community}$$ . To achieve this collaboration, the ICDC Steering Committee was formed 
        to advise the NCI and FNLCR on the ICDC. The Steering Committee is composed of 11 members 
        from the non-NIH research community, 7 from NCI, 1 from NHGRI and 1 from NCATS. There is also 
        1 observer from the NCI and 4 ex-officio members who are FNLCR staff. The chairperson is from 
        the $$non-NIH research community](cnn.com)$$  non-NIH research community. Testing'
    - paragraph: 'The Steering Committee has two sub-committees; Data Governance Advisory Board (DGAB) 
        and the Best Practices Sub-Committee (BPSC).'
    - paragraph: 'The DGAB consists of 4 external members (all from ICDC Steering Committee), 2 NIH members 
        (1 of whom is from CBIIT) and is supported by FNLCR staff. When researchers request their data ($${submission guide [PDF]}$$) 
        to be added to the ICDC to be shared with the community, the role of the DGAB is to advise the NCI on the suitability 
        of request. The NCI makes the final decision on the request. The DGAB is chaired by a non-NIH member of ICDC Steering 
        Committee. The DGAB meets at least quarterly to review and prioritize all open and complete requests.'
    - paragraph: 'The BPSC consists of 7 external members (all from ICDC Steering Committee), 3 NCI staff, 1 NHGRI staff 
        and is supported by FNLCR staff. The overall goal of the BPSC is to streamline and standardize data collection 
        and management for canine studies. The BPSC examines past and planned studies and recommends prospective standards 
        for data collection and management in four main areas; imaging, clinical/pathology, immunology and genomic/sequencing data.'

  content:
    - paragraph: '$$#CRDC:#$$'
    - paragraph: '$$[The Cancer Research DataCommons](https://datascience.cancer.gov/data-commons)$$ is an initiative from NCI’s Center for Biomedical
        Informatics & Information Technology ( $$[CBIIT](https://datascience.cancer.gov/)$$). CBIIT’s vision for the project consists of a 
        virtual, expandable infrastructure that provides secure access to many different data types across scientific domains, 
        allowing users to analyze, share, and store results, leveraging the storage and elastic compute, or ability to easily scale resources, of the 
        cloud. The ability to combine diverse data types and perform cross-domain analysis of large data sets can lead to new discoveries in cancer prevention, 
        treatment and diagnosis, and supports the goals of precision medicine and the Cancer Moonshot℠.'
    - paragraph: '$$#CLOUD RESOURCES:#$$'
    - paragraph: The CRDC has three Cloud Resourcesoutbounnd web site icon options (
        $$[Seven Bridges Cancer Genomics Cloud ](http://www.cancergenomicscloud.org/)$$,$$[ISB Cancer Genomics Cloud ](https://isb-cgc.appspot.com/)$$, $$[Terra ](https://terra.bio/)$$),
        each providing analysis platforms for the community to use when working with Data Commons data.
    - paragraph: 'These cloud-based platforms eliminate the need for researchers to download and store extremely large data sets by allowing them to bring 
        analysis tools to the data in the cloud, instead of the traditional process of bringing the data to the tools on local hardware. The Cloud Resources 
        also provide access to on-demand computational capacity to analyze these data. The Cloud Resources allow users to run best practice tools and pipelines 
        already implemented or upload their own data or analysis methods to workspaces.'
    - paragraph: 'All three Cloud Resources provide support for data access through a web-based user interface in addition to programmatic access to analytic 
       tools and workflows, and the capability of sharing results with collaborators. Each Cloud Resource is continually developing new functionality to improve 
       the user experience and add new tools for researchers.'
    - paragraph: '$$*SEVEN BRIDGES CANCER GENOMICS CLOUD (SBG)*$$ is hosted on Amazon Web Services and has a rich user interface that allows researchers to find data of 
       interest and combine it with their own private data. Data can be analyzed using more than 200 preinstalled, curated bioinformatics tools and workflows. 
       Researchers can also extend the functionality of the platform by adding their own data and tools via an intuitive software development kit.'
    - paragraph: '$$*INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY CANCER GENOMICS CLOUD (ISB-CGC)*$$ leveraging many aspects of the Google Cloud Platform, allows scientists to 
       interactively define and compare cohorts, examine underlying molecular data for specific genes and pathways, and share insights with collaborators. 
       For computational users, Application Program Interfaces (APIs) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources such as BigQuery and Google Pipeline service, 
       allow complex queries from R or Python scripts, or Dockerized workflows to run on data available in the Google Cloud Storage.'
    - paragraph: '$$*IBROAD INSTITUTE TERRA*$$ is an open, standards-based platform for performing production-scale data analysis in the cloud. Built on the Google 
       Cloud Platform, Terra empowers analysts, tool developers, and production managers to run large-scale analysis and to share results with collaborators. 
       Users can upload their own analysis methods and data to workspaces or run the Broad’s best practice tools and pipelines.'
    - paragraph: '$$*FROM ICDC TO CLOUD RESOURCES:*$$'
    - paragraph: 'Researchers find cases/cohorts in ICDC and then identify the files they would like to use for analysis. This list of files is called a Manifest. 
        The user will download the Manifest and then upload the Manifest into SBG where the files will be available for analysis. The user will need a SBG account. 
        The Manifest file is a text file consisting of CRDC Identifiers and, on uploading to SBG, the user will be able to access the relevant data files and see 
        some basic case information.'
    - paragraph: 'This Cloud Resource analysis model eliminates the need for researchers to download and store extremely large data sets by allowing them to bring 
        analysis tools to the data in the cloud, instead of the traditional process of bringing the data to the tools on local hardware. The Cloud Resources also

  title: "Submitting Data"
  content:
    - paragraph: 'The ICDC was established to further research on human cancers by enabling comparative analysis with 
       canine cancer. If a researcher has data that will help this mission and they are willing to share that data in 
       the ICDC, they will make a request through our $${submission request process [PDF]}$$. 
       Please email $$@ICDCHelpDesk@mail.nih.gov@$$ for instructions. All data in the ICDC will be made publicly available.'
    - paragraph: 'Projects need not be complete to start the request. Indeed, working with the ICDC before defining your data 
       collection processes can be beneficial, as the ICDC can help advise on best practices that will enable more 
       efficient and effective submission of the data.'
    - paragraph: '$$#EXPECTATIONS OF DATA:#$$'
    - paragraph: 'Once a project is accepted into the ICDC, the ICDC Data Team will work with the submitter to review the data 
       (i.e., by looking at data structure, data values, and data quality, as well as identifying any standards). The 
       review in turn leads to a submission plan between ICDC and the submitter.'
    - paragraph: 'In developing the submission plan, a primary consideration is that consumers of the data will 
       not be as familiar with the data as the project owners. For example, submitters may find “lymphoma” 
       implicit as a diagnosis in a given data set and thus not have use for such a field. However, this 
       field would need to be explicit for the research community as a whole.'
    - paragraph: 'General guidelines have been established to leverage available community standards where possible 
       for both field name and acceptable values. Common data quality issues are: inconsistent spelling 
       (haemotology versus hematology), inconsistent formatting (“Male” versus “male”), concatenated values 
       which should be separate (“neutered male” should be values in two separate fields), gaps in data 
       (Null data versus empty data versus data not collected) and format (Excel or other database compatible formats versus PDF). 
       The ICDC data team will work with the submitter to identify and resolve these issues.'
- page: '/purpose'
  title: "Purpose"
  content:
    - paragraph: "NCI's Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) charged the Frederick National Laboratory 
       for Cancer Research (FNLCR) to build the Integrated Canine Data Commons (ICDC), a cloud-based repository 
       of canine cancer data. ICDC was established to further research on human cancers by enabling comparative 
       analysis with canine cancer. The data in the ICDC is sourced from multiple different programs and projects; 
       all focused on the canine subjects. The data is harmonized into an integrated data model and then made available 
       to the research community. The ICDC is part of the Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC), an initiative from 
       NCI’s Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (CBIIT). Bioinformatic analysis of the 
       ICDC data is accomplished using the CRDC’s $$[Cloud Resources](https://datascience.cancer.gov/data-commons/cloud-resources)$$."
    - paragraph: 'Within the FNLCR, the Biomedical Informatics and Data Science (BIDS) Directorate is focused on software engineering 
       and data handling. The Applied and Developmental Research Directorate (ADRD) is managing the ICDC Steering Committee 
       and providing one of the data sources for the ICDC. Finally, there is also an ICDC Steering Committee 
       (composed of external members, FNLCR and NCI staff) that provides advice to DCTD on the ICDC.'

  content:
    - paragraph: '$$#HARMONIZATION/INTEGRATION:#$$'
    - paragraph: 'The ICDC functions best for the research community when the data is integrated. Once a project 
        is accepted into the ICDC, the ICDC data team will work with the submitter to review the data looking 
        at data structure, data values, data quality as well as identifying any standards that were utilized. 
        Based on that review, a plan for how to submit the data will be agreed upon between ICDC and the submitter.'
    - paragraph: '$$#FAIR AND CITING:#$$'
    - paragraph: 'The ICDC will adhere to $$[FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)$$ principles of data stewardship: Findable, Accessible, 
        Interoperable, and Reusable. Please credit the ICDC in your manuscript. When citing individual projects, 
        please refer to the attribution policies of the project when available.'
    - paragraph: '$$#LICENCE#$$'
    - paragraph: 'Data made available through the ICDC is for research purposes only. The ICDC provides researchers with 
        access to data from canine cancer studies to enable exploratory analysis that cannot be considered definitive for 
        outcomes. All data is publicly available.'
    - paragraph: '$$#DATA MODEL:#$$'
    - paragraph: 'The ICDC data model is a representation of how all the constituent data are arranged relative to each 
        other. Given the number of studies, the range of study types and the multiple data types that the ICDC needs 
        to support, the data model will need to adapt to the needs of the science. The data model is not static and 
        is expected to change as new needs are identified.'
    - paragraph: 'The SVG graphic below represents the current ICDC data model consisting of data nodes, 
        node properties, and relationships (edges). It provides a comprehensive mapping of the system data, 
        part of which may be viewed in the application interface and UI. In other words, additional nodes and 
        properties are available for inspection and querying beyond those presented on the front-end.'
    - paragraph: 'Additionally, the ICDC Data Model serves as a template for similar initiatives and data structures, 
        including graph-based database schemas. The model will continue to evolve as data needs are further discerned.'
